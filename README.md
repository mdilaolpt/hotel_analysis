## Overview
The Hotel Performance Analysis project aims to analyze the revenue and occupancy trends of five hotels (EXIUS, GCBJN, ICWAS, PHEGA, and UKPIL) over a period from 2019 to 2021. The analysis includes forecasting revenue and occupancy for each hotel to provide insights and recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze revenue and occupancy data for each hotel from 2019 to 2021.
